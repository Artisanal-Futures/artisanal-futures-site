          Welcome to Artisanal Futures!{' '}
        </h1>

        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          Thank you for joining the Artisanal Futures platform. Our mission is
          to help worker-owned businesses, worker collectives, artisanal
          enterprise, and other forms of grass-roots economic development and
          civic support. The “big picture” goal is to replace the extractive
          economy of big corporations, who put the lion’s share in their own
          pockets, with a community-based economy that returns value to those
          who generate it. For businesses, the Artisanal Futures platform
          provides collaboration tools: for example, linking local supply chains
          such as farms and restaurants, or sharing access to AI or other
          technologies. For the public, it provides a marketplace where
          consumers are buying locally, saving money by buying in bulk, sharing
          knowledge, and engaging in other civic activities that might improve
          education and environments and even feed back into our business
          participants. Thus, it is a vision for the transition to a decolonized
          circular economy.

            featured. If you are unable to do so at that time, you can always
